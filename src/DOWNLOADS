Hello,

I am an undergraduate researcher at the University of California,
Irvine.  I am using GENESIS for large network modeling and need
extracellular potentials (meaning I need transmembrane current traces
for all the cells).  Just last friday I projected the model was going
to spit out 17GB/sec of data, and I was talking with my Professor
today about what to do about it.  Funny coincidence.  Thanks for your
work!

-- compression ratios:

The data is transmembrane currents (specifically the "Im" and "inject"
fields of compartment objects are recorded).  My research advisor and
I both believe "Im - inject"
gives the correct value for this quantity.  The data is used for
calculating extracellular potentials by approximating spherical
compartments as point sources and cylindrical compartments as line
sources.  I believe the compression ratio is about 1:8 or 9, although
I only tested it on a small file.  I can give you a better number as
soon as I make sure the MATLAB reader will work and make a big file.
I can definitely tell you it is much preferable to genesis' ASCII
output (effectively about 15*8 = 120bits per sample).
